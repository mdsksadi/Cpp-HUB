# Basic Instruction

Linked list is a non continuous collection
Linked list consists 2 thing:
* Value. 
* Address of the next element.

Address of last element store be NULL
1st element of a linked list is called "head"

# Advantage of linked list:
Array is fixed size but linked list is dinamic size. So, I can add new element or remove existing element.

# Disadvantage of linked list:
Random access to the element of a linkd list is not allowed.
  * Because you need the address of the element and the address is stored to the previous element.
  * So, always need to start from the 1st (head) element.
   
Linked list needs more memory.

Because linked list needs to store 2 things.
  1. Value of the element and 
  2. Pointer of the next element.
  
  So, it needs more storage.

Linked list data tipe is always user defined.

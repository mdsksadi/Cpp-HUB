# What is a Queue?
* Queue is a FIFO/FCFS (First in first out/ First come, first served) data structure.
> **For Example:** Bank
# When do we use Queue in programming?
- Whenever we need things with exact order but my computer can not keep up with the spped and execute those things first enough, on that time I need put those things in a *Queue*
- >**For Example:** They way that printers works. I can send multiple pages to print. As printer is very slow and it takes 5 to 10 seconds to print out each page, all of the pages will be waiting in a ***queue*** and they will be waiting for their turn to be printed. Pages will be printed from the front of the queue.
    >> Printing sequence will be: Page 1, then page 2, then page 3 and so on. If I add new page, it will go at the end.
# 5 most important functions that are associated with Queue (*same as STACK*)
  1. Function that will say, the Queue is empty or not (Empty)
  2. Function that will say the size of the Queue (Size)
  3. Function that will give the top element of the Queue (Top)
  4. Function that add element into the Queue (Push)
  5. Function to remeove element from the Queue (Pop)
   
# Steps:
1. include **queue**
2. ***queue***<type of element (eg. ***int***)>***numbersStack***(name of the stack)
3. Continue.........
